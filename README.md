# Simulation 

I'm kind of stuck at the moment without a laptop (it was stolen!) / unemployed, so I will spend some
time practicing C++ by writing simulation code on my raspberry pi.

I probably won't finish this. 

## What is it?
At the very least, I just want to implement some basic particle
physics. Visualization may not make it in; it depends on how much time
I spend unemployed.

I'm keeping it 2D so that if I do visualization, it can actually run
on a Pi.
